# Exercises

1. **Is unique** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique
   characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
    * Try a hash table
    * Could a bit detector be useful?
    * Can you solve it in `O(N log N)` time?

    To run benchmarks: `go test -bench=.`
